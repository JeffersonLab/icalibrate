        <p>The iCalibrate application is for operators at JLab, and assists in ion chamber calibration.</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The iCalibrate application is distributed as an executable jar file.
                The iCalibrate application requires Java 8 or greater and can be launched on Linux with the following command:
            </p>
            <pre><kbd>
./icalibrate.sh                
            </kbd></pre>  
            Or to have debugging logged to the console:
            <pre><kbd>
./debug-icalibrate.sh                
            </kbd></pre>
            Or to invoke Java manually (without the bash shell's Java version check):
            <pre><kbd>
java -jar icalibrate.jar                
            </kbd></pre>
            <p>
                The versioning is organized into "major.minor" where major 
                versions indicate API changes and minor versions are for bug 
                fixes and implementation changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                A Java properties file named icalibrate.properties is located in the config directory.
                Users can set various configuration parameters there.  
                There is also an epics.properties file which instructs iCalibrate how to connect to EPICS.
            </p>      
            <h2>Source Code</h2>
            <p>The Java iCalibrate application is named <em>icalibrate</em> 
                and is stored in the git repository on devl00.  It can be
                accessed by members of the JLab accelerator group <em>epics</em> 
                from an accelerator Linux machine with the command:</p>
            <pre><kbd>
git clone ssh://devl00/usr/devsite/git/icalibrate.git 
            </kbd></pre>
            <p>
                An Apache Ant build file (build.xml) is used to compile and
                package the application.
            </p>   
        </div>
