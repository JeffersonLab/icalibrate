        <p>The iCalibrate application is for operators at JLab, and assists in ion chamber calibration.  The application was originally developed using the Netbeans Matisse form builder for Java Swing.</p>
        <div>
            <h1>Usage</h1>
            <p>
                The iCalibrate application is distributed in both a zip and tar file.
                The application requires Java 8 and can be launched on Linux and Windows using the start scripts created by the Gradle build:
            </p>
            <pre><kbd>
bin/icalibrate(.bat)
            </kbd></pre>
            <p>
                <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> is used (major.minor.patch) where major
                versions indicate incompatible API changes, minor versions are backwards compatible enhancements,
                and patch versions are for backwards compatible bug fixes.
            </p>

            <h1>Configuration</h1>
            <p>
                A Java properties file named icalibrate.properties is located in the config directory.
                Users can set various configuration parameters there.  
                There is also an epics.properties file which instructs iCalibrate how to connect to EPICS.
            </p>      
            <h1>Source Code</h1>
            <p>Can be found on <a href="https://github.com/JeffersonLab/icalibrate">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>
                A Gradle build file (build.gradle) is used to compile and
                package the application.
